Words in Sentence 1:
["I", "love", "eating", "an", "apple", "every", "morning"]
→ Count = 7

Words in Sentence 2:
["She", "eats", "an", "apple", "in", "the", "morning"]
→ Count = 7

 Common Words
Common words: "an", "apple", "morning"
→ Common = 3

 Jaccard Formula Application
Total unique words = Count1 + Count2 - Common = 7 + 7 - 3 = 11
